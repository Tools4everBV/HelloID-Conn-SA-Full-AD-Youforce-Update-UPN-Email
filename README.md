## Manual resources
This Delegated Form uses the following resources in order to run

### Powershell data source 'AD-Beaufort-account-update-upn-email-lookup-user-generate-table'
This Powershell data source runs an Active Directory query to search for matching AD user accounts. It uses an array of Active Directory OU's specified as HelloID user-defined variable named _"ADusersSearchOU"_ to specify the search scope. This data source returns additional attributes that receive the current values for UserPrincipalName/EmailAddress and also split them into a prefix and a suffix for future uses.

### Powershell data source 'AD-Beaufort-account-update-upn-email-table-user-details'
This Powershell data source runs an Active Directory query to select an extended list of user attributes of the selected AD user account. 

### Powershell data source 'AD-Beaufort-account-update-upn-email-validation'
This Powershell data source runs an Active Directory query to validate the uniqueness of the new UserPrincipalName and EmailAddress. Both values are also validated in ProxyAddresses. And will return a "Valid" or "Invalid" text. This text is used for validation in the form.

### Delegated form task 'AD Beaufort Account - Update UPN - Email'
This delegated form task will update two systems. On the AD user account the attributes UserPrincipalName, EmailAddress and ProxyAddresses will be updated (old Primairy 'SMTP:' will be replaced by a alais 'smtp:'). On the Beaufort employee the attributes EmAd will be updated.

## Add another systems to update
It is possible to add another systems to update the UserPrincipalName and EmailAddress by adding them in the task script. It is also possible to send a [email](https://docs.helloid.com/en/service-automation/products/product-tasks.html#email-sends-in-powershell-product-tasks) with the task script.
